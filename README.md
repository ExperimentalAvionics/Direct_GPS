# Direct GPS

This simple Python script reads the NMEA data from GPS receiver connected to Raspberry Pi via USB and sends the data into CAN-Bus network.

Note: 
This is most simple way to get some basic GPS data at the rate of 1 message per second using default NMEA protocol.
It is very generic and should work with almost all USB GPS units.
Most GPS units can do MUCH more but the code should be a bit more speciffic. Stay tuned for that. :)
